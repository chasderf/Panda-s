#Note: By default, the dropna() method returns a new DataFrame, and will not change the original.

#If you want to change the original DataFrame, use the inplace = True argument:

import pandas as pd

df = pd.read_csv('data.csv')

df.dropna(inplace = True)

print(df.to_string())

#Notice in the result that some rows have been removed (row 18, 22 and 28).

#These rows had cells with empty values.
