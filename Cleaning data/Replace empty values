#Another way of dealing with empty cells is to insert a new value instead.

#This way you do not have to delete entire rows just because of some empty cells.

#The fillna() method allows us to replace empty cells with a value:

import pandas as pd

df = pd.read_csv('data.csv')

df.fillna(130, inplace = True)

print(df.to_string())

#Notice in the result: empty cells got the value 130 (in row 18, 22 and 28)
