#One of the most used method for getting a quick overview of the DataFrame, is the head() method.
#The head() method returns the headers and a specified number of rows, starting from the top.

#Note: if the number of rows is not specified, the head() method will return the top 5 rows.


import pandas as pd

df = pd.read_csv('data.csv')

print(df.head(10))
